  Pokemon was a big part of my childhood, I used to watch them, play and talk about them with my friends. I even had a notebook with all the pokemon names written on it (by myself). As I was learning about APIs, I found <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeApi</a>, what better way to learn about APIs than creating your own PokeDex using the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeApi</a>. PokeDex is collection of details of the pokemons.
